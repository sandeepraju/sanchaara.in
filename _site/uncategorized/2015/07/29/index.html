          <p>For the ones who have been with us since the beginning, from where we started blogging in Sanchaara way back in 2013, you would have followed us on a range of experiences from way down south - Pondi to the foothill of Himalayas.</p>

<p>Never lose an opportunity to see anything beautiful! Over these years this bunch of friends have ignited the wanderlust in me. And rightly said, Journey is best measured in friends than miles. At a point where we were about to take a detour..</p>

<p>Before I get more nostalgic, let me digress here..</p>

<p>We decided on heading to Wayanad. Monsoon is the time to be in God’s own country! :)</p>

<p>Unlike our previous trips, this time we did not plan much. We hit the road at around 12 late night, and took the Bangalore - Mysore - Gundulpet - Munthanga - Sulthan Bathery route. We reached the Bandipur forest check-post around 4 in the morning and waited until the gates opened at 6. Bandipur, located in Chamarajanagar district of Karnataka forms the heart of dense forest of the Western Ghats along with three other adjoining national parks - Nagarhole, Madhumalai and Wayanad Wildlife sanctuary. The road en route to Wayanad is picturesque with lush green trees. We could spot few wildlife on our way. A happy monsoon invited us, as we got down the cab with umbrellas open.</p>

<p><a href="https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/rain.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-314" src="https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/rain.png?w=750" alt="" width="750" height="499" /></a></p>

<p>Sulthan Bathery being the commercial hub in Wayanad, is the best place to stay. We freshened up and headed towards our first stop - Eddkal caves. There is a short trek along the finely laid steps up the Ambukuthi hills to reach the caves. After clicking some photographs, and smiling at the tourists around who were all excited and equally drenched in rain, we reached the top and the monsoon view from there was amazing! Inside the caves there are huge split rocks, ancient stone scripts and pictorial wall inscriptions. An official guide there, explained us with pleasure the history of the place. We spent some time enjoying the beauty of the caves. On our way back we munched on some yummy homemade chocolates.</p>

<p>Our next stop - Banasura sagar dam. We were tricked by google maps to take the most un-convenient route to this place. Phew! The roads we took were so narrow and we were almost lost! After dodging against the edges of the narrow roads, we reached the dam. A short walk took us to a serene location which looked like the best strokes with water paint colors. The view of the sunshine filtering through the clouds across the landscape was one of the most beautiful view we had ever seen. We pretty much spent the rest of the day staring at this view.</p>

<p>We got back to the hotel in Sulthan Bathery at around 8 in the evening. No trip is complete without crazy night-outs. Bye bye to mafia :P This time we had a new game! - &lt;insert-game-name&gt;. One hell of a crazy game. The rules are simple. examples -</p>

<p>Like always, we all woke up late the next morning. We hadn’t planned on any sunrise view points, as we were 100% sure of starting late. Next stop was - Jain temple, Sulthan Bathery. This is one of the famous tourist places in Wayanad. The town derives the name from from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipu_Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore">Mysore</a> who killed all the Jain Monks and used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism_in_Kerala">Jain</a> temple as his battery here in the 18th century, hence the name Sultan’s Battery.

<p>Holiday in Kerala is incomplete without a visit to any luscious waterfalls. There are plenty of small and large streams famous in Kerala, and we chose on visiting Kanthampara falls. As we drove closer to the waterfalls we imagined ourselves walking through a picturesque forest.. With the rushing sound of the waterfall in the background and that we would arrive at the base of the waterfalls and look up at the water gushing through the rocks.. Oh stop! The main entry point to the waterfalls was closed :/ Since it was the peak of monsoon, we could only stand by one of the alternate entry points and watch the water flow in rage. It was pretty disappointing! But the refreshingly beautiful view of the tea plantation on our way back to the main city made up for all the loss.</p>

<p>The same night we headed back to Bangalore. Endless talks, laughter, stupid fights, scary stories, music, pulling-leg, rain, food, coffee.. The trip was fun! :D</p>

          <p>If you are one of the them who has watched the beautiful sunrise at Nandi hills, consider yourself lucky! Nothing is more beautiful than perching on a hill and watching the sun rise. Every sun shine brings in hope :)</p>

<p>[caption id=”attachment_322” align=”alignnone” width=”653”]<a href="https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/sunrise-at-nandi-hills.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-322" src="https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/sunrise-at-nandi-hills.jpg" alt="Photo Courtesy :" width="653" height="490" /></a> Photo Courtesy :[/caption]</p>

<p>We hate being late, but we are so good at it ;) We missed the beautiful sunrise, but the nature was in mood to treat us with something special that day.. We started around 6 in the morning and the drive was pleasant. Driving along the zig zag roads and the hair pin curves was fun :D We could see a lot of people cycling back. Probably they were one of the lucky ones ;)</p>

<p><a href="https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/dsc06184.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-323" src="https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/dsc06184.jpg?w=750" alt="DSC06184" width="750" height="563" /></a></p>

<p><b>Nandi Hills</b> or <b>Nandidurg</b>  is an ancient hill fortress in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chikkaballapur_district">Chikkaballapur district</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka">Karnataka</a>. It is 10 km from Chickballapur town and approximately 60 km from the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengaluru">Bengaluru</a>. The hills are nestled near the town of Nandi. [source-wiki].</p>

<p>We were welcomed by a huge arched fort entrance, where the ticket counter is. All vehicles have to be parked a little further from this entrance. If you are planning to carry any food items up the hills, get ready to negotiate with the monkeys! The monkeys here are super smart! We were hungry and planned to munch on something inside the car at the parking space. It just took two minutes for the smarties to notice this and call a bunch of others to raid us. Within no time there were monkeys all over the car, trying to figure out how to get into the car. One of the monkeys was jumping on the bonnet hoping to find a magical entrance. We then had to pack all the food stuffs back into a bag and slowly move the car to a different parking space. Even as we got down the car, few of the monkeys were still giving us evil looks :P There are beautiful tree houses near the parking space. Everyone around were busy getting photos clicked at this spot.</p>

<p><a href="https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/dsc06193.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-325" src="https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/dsc06193.jpg?w=750" alt="DSC06193" width="750" height="563" /></a></p>

<p>There are a couple of temples here. As you walk up the hill you will love and hate the wind at the same time. The fierce wind blowing into your face gives some freaking awesome vibes to ask for more of it!! You asked for a break from monotony, and here you have it :D The experience is amazing!</p>

<p><a href="https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/dsc06237.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-326" src="https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/dsc06237.jpg?w=750" alt="DSC06237" width="750" height="563" /></a></p>

<p>Another famous spot here is the Tipu drop. Supposedly the spot where Tipu used to execute the unlawful. As we watched the curled up roads from this spot, the wind got more fierce. The view was amazing, but we could hardly hold ourselves against the wind, and we slowly moved back to the gate. This demanded a hot cup of coffee. There is a nandini parlour near the parking space, which serves the perfect blend of coffee. We relaxed here for a while as we discussed what next..</p>

<p><a href="https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/dsc06262.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-327" src="https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/dsc06262.jpg?w=750" alt="DSC06262" width="750" height="563" /></a></p>

<p>Little do people know about the birthplace of Vishveshvaraya - Muddenahalli, which is about 15kms from Nandi hills. The museum here has a large collections of Sir MV’s photographs, writings and some rare belongings. Beside the museum is the ancestral home which is the birthplace of Sir MV. At walkable distance from this place is the samadhi park. The whole environment around here instills an inspiring feeling. We unanimously felt the same while going through the belongings and the writings in the museum.</p>

<p>We then started our drive back to bangalore. The trip ended with a sumptuous lunch :)</p>

<p>Tips : Do not miss on the fresh grapes and jackfruits sold by the locals in and around Chikballapur :)</p>

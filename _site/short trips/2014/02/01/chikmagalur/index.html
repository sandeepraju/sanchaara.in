<p style="text-align:justify;">Bags packed, we sat on the edge of the bed making small talks, constantly waiting for the clock to tick and the phone to ring, for our turn to be picked up. This moment was the result of more than a week’s meticulous planning since it was our first trip with friends. It was a couple of months since we picked up new jobs and the endless chit-chat, hanging around was no more a daily routine. All excited, we were to get back to the fun gang we had formed back in college, the friendship which was built on the strong foundation of sarcasm and laughter! This trip had to be Epic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After maneuvering the cab through the Bangalore traffic for more than an hour, we were on the outskirts of the city. There started the unlimited talks, giggles, laughter!! Getting to the destination is half the fun.. The best part of going with your close buddies is that you don’t have to start afresh! Feels like taking a piece of home along :)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our first stop was Mullayanagiri. Located in Chikmagalur district, Mullayanagiri is the highest peak in South India. Before the crack of dawn, we reached the foot of the pathway to the hill-top. All excited we stepped out of the cab. For once the cold waves chased us back to the cab! The walk up the hill was intimidating. It was pitch dark. All we could see was few steps ahead of us using torch light and the beautiful city lights deep down on the side. We could hardly sense our fingertips! The stormy wind made it hard to cling on. We made it through the stairway to heaven and reached the top right on time to soak up the early morning sun. The beauty began to unravel. We were spellbound with what we saw around. We were amidst the clouds! the sun rays peeking in.. The photos speak in volumes and the experience can possibly never be put in words. We then visited a small shiva temple perched on this hill.</p>

Often we are cautioned against eating at the local streets in new places. But the freshness, the smell, the sizzle! just couldn’t stop ourselves from savoring hot bhajjis, followed by dosas with generous helping of some spicy chutney. Not to forget us guzzling hot tea asking for more and more to beat the bone chilling cold. That made a scrumptious breakfast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our next stop was Jhari falls. After missing a few signboards and going the wrong way and asking the driver to take a reverse and probably being cursed for it, we finally reached an old gate in ruins which lead to Jhari falls. It was a short trek to the foot of the falls. The paths laid out are very convenient to walk. The beauty of this waterfall is that you can reach to the very foot of the falls with little effort. The spray drenches when we get close to the falls. Only when one tries to take a shower there they realize the torrent and the brute force of the water. Nevertheless this added to the list of epic experiences. The leeches had a feast on us that day. Not sure who got the highest leech bite score :P</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">After visiting the cave-like structures at Bababudangiri, next on our list was Manikyadhara. This place is considered to be sacred. Jeeps are the best way to commute from Bababudangiri to Manikyadhara. We spoke to a few Jeep drivers around and settled in one of the jeeps  waiting for it to leave. The jeep had two long seats facing each other in the rear, and a long seat next to the driver in the front. As more ladies hopped in-to the back seats, the guys got out to make space. Few minutes later we realized, there were around 10 people in the rear seat, 5 people crammed in the front and 2 clinging on the sides like going for a rally, and few others on the top! Oh wait, the driver himself was not in yet.. and he barely managed to get space of less than a few inches for himself! With around 22 people in the jeep, the driver drove with all ease. They are used to overloading the vehicle with such a crowd. According to him it was indeed less number of people that day! We spent the rest of the day enjoying the local places around.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bored of being in sophisticated environment all the time we chose a homestay - to feel the rustic way of life. Few reasons why one should go for a homestay is that they are available in plenty and for the authentic yummy home made food. It’s a trend today where the locals run it as a business. The invaluable first hand insights that the locals can provide us about the area around can never be matched with any information in the travelogues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next morning we started pretty late, owing to most of us oversleeping. Reached the peaks of Kemmanagundi by noon. Surprisingly the weather was just too perfect. A moment of bliss. We were awestruck by the silence and serenity the place had to offer. It was a tacit agreement to spend the next few hours in solitude. Listening to the gushing wind thoughts warred within us. Lost in ourselves seeking answers to a lot of questions bothering us off-late. It was undoubtedly a tranquil moment at the end! Made us strongly believe that those moments of inner peace do exist. Rightly said, nothing can substitute experience.</p>

<p>After lunch we started our way back to Bangalore. The trip was indeed Epic! Refilled with energy and enthu as we drove closer to our destination, our minds started to think about what exciting was in store for us in the coming months..</p>

<p>We were back with a Bang to Bangalore! :)</p>

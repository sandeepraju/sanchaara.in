It was 10:00 pm. The busy Bangalore was slowing down and gradually drifting towards sleep unlike the Hebbal flyover infront of us which is always busy with airport taxi’s and transport vehicles. Sandeep and myself were eagerly waiting for the beginning of our next trip(after chikamagalur). Our mobile phones were continuously beeping with WhatsApp messages like “ಮಗ ಎಲ್ಲಿದಿರೊ”(Guys where are you?) as we were expecting a ride from a hired TT (Tempo traveler.. :P) which of course had already picked up most of the crazy people of our gang.


Finally after picking us and Mahesh, the journey began. Journey to where? A place in the western ghats - “Dandeli”. A big thanks to the Google navigation app which was constantly showing us the directions in the dreadful midnight to Dandeli although at some places it told us to take a right turn when there was no place to turn at all. It was around 6:00 in the morning when each of us started to wake up one by one. The moment we turned towards the window we could see our TT riding on a road with forests on either sides. A typical countryside view made us happy, reminding us that we were now away from traffic signals and concrete forest.


We reached Dandeli around 7:30 in the morning where our traveling agent had arranged for a guide vehicle from Dandeli town to Pradhani, a small village. In Pradhani, we stayed at Dandeli Jungle camp. Because of the overnight journey we all were really tired and craving for a good breakfast. But the breakfast was still not ready. We got 4 rooms in the camp and we split ourselves into four groups. We quickly refreshed and moved towards to the dining area. Hot upma, omelette, bread-butter-jam, coffee and tea was something which we needed to get going. After hogging, we were all set to start the Dandeli extravaganza.

The first plan was to visit Syntheri Rocks, a natural rock formation by the river. The only means of transport to the place were the local jeeps because of the muddy roads. We had to wait for sometime for a local jeep to take us there. In the meantime we decided to just walk around the jungle camp and we didn't regret. We came across a dry paddy field in which a woman was husking. A rare scene in the city side, isn't it?

Finally our jeep arrived to the jungle camp and we hurriedly boarded the jeep as we were very excited to visit Syntheri rocks. The jeep started to move in the midst of dense thick forests and we were welcomed by a couple of wild animals like baboons and wild eagles. After 60 minutes of amazing forest journey we arrived at Syntheri rocks. The view of Syntheri rocks became clear gradually as we stepped down the rocky stairs one by one and the view of the majestic rocks - you bet it was breathtaking. The hard mountain rocks were carved to be beautiful stones by the chilling water drifting between the mountain spaces. We wished if could have seen this beauty in rainy season when the river will be full. But anyone visiting this place must be very careful as the stone surfaces are very smooth due to continuously flowing river. If you fall to water accidentally then the chance of survival is too less…meaning…"COMPLETE  ಹೊಗೆ" :P

After Syntheri, we came back to jungle camp for a munchy lunch. The lunch was better than breakfast and there was only veg food. After hogging we are ready for the next big thing...WATER SPORTS...hurrah! Since Dandeli jungle camp doesn't have any water sports they took us to Bison resort by a jeep again. There, people were already having fun.. Kayaking, natural Jacuzzi bath and Coracle rides! Oh.. By the way, the river we spoke about all this time is River Kali. We decided to do only Kayaking and Natural Jacuzzi bath as the Coracle ride wasn't worth(The water sports + to and fro travel to resort costed us Rs. 500). There were kayaking boats for both single and pair rowers. Kayaking was really an amazing experience. Sailing a short flat boat(Kayak) by using a double-bladed paddle is not so simple as it appears. You can either choose to sail in peace enjoying the lush greenery on either sides of the river or you can choose to make some noise which will scare the hell out of birds living in the trees. I remember one of my friend screaming "I am happy, I am happy". Hey wait, I don’t know swimming, what if the boat flips over!? No worries.. life jacket and life guards to the rescue. Your rescue mission will be pakka accomplished.

After Kayaking now it’s the turn to enjoy natural Jacuzzi bath. This one thing you should definitely not miss. The bath place is in the middle of the river where water gushes through certain rocky spaces where you can sit. The chilling water applies uniform pressure on your muscles which give u a sense of getting a good massage. It was a simply superb experience. I can still remember the noise made by the gushing water surrounding my body. Concentrating on that sound you will reach a peaceful state of mind forgetting all the tensions of daily life. But there is always an end to everything. We had to come out of natural Jacuzzi bath as the sun gradually set down saying “bye” to evening. With the immense satisfaction of a great experience, we headed back to our Pradhani village. On the way, we just stopped by the backwaters and Kali dam. The view was amazing.

So after a fun-filled day we were back to jungle camp. Hmm so what next? Of course how can there not be a camp fire in such a place. After a quick refresh we all gathered around the camp fire. Guess what? we were not the only group of people in the jungle camp. So there is camp fire and bunch of friendly people.. that means <em>fun shuru ho jaye.</em> Ahem.. Ahem.. For us the fun means dumb charades.. :P Dumb charades and Camp fire both ended at the same time. Now by this time we were really starving.. so it was time for hot food. The dinner was also good but this time we had both veg and non-veg options. The hunger for food was over but the hunger for fun was not even half complete. So we requested the manager to set a small campfire in front of our rooms. There were chit chats, dance and Mafia. Yes you read it right...Mafia.. Are baba.. it’s  a  game. Please google it out to know more about this game. More the number of people, more will be the fun in this game. It was almost 12:30 midnight when we all wished “ಶುಭರಾತ್ರಿ”(good night) to everyone and went to sleep. But before we went to bed, we all wished just for one thing..."Let the Kali dam be open for tomo". Hmmm..why this specific wish?......... Because we were crazy about going rafting  :P


But as you people know God doesn’t grant all your wishes. We woke up at around 6:00 am to find out that we will not be able to raft... so you know what we did?... we went back to sleep… :P


Now, what can substitute the adventure and fun of rafting? Is it a trek to a waterfall in the middle of a forest? You bet.. Any trip with friends would be incomplete without a visit to waterfalls. So which one did we pick? Do you remember the absolutely splendid waterfalls shown in the recent Sharukh Khan movie “Chennai Express”? If you are a Kannada movie fan then you would have seen it in “Myna” movie too. If you have guessed it right... it’s none other than Dudhsagar.


## DudhSagar
You can reach Dudhsagar either by road or by train but train route being the most popular. For people from Karnataka it is the Castle rock route. The distance from Dandeli to Castle Rock railway station is about 42.1 km. After reaching the Castle Rock railway station, you can either go by a train or hike on the railway track for about 14kms. Now comes the tricky part. There are no places to stay near Dudhsagar - obvious because it is in the middle of the forest. So you have to return back before the sun sets down unless you are crazy enough to roam like ghosts on a lonely railway track in a creepy jungle. Did I say lonely track? Yes because it is not a track where hundred’s of trains visit every day. According to the gyaan of the resort owner, there is just one train that stops at Castle Rock station. So you have to plan well in advance such that you don’t miss this train. The train leaves Castle Rock station by around 10:30 PM. Now once you board this train, make sure that you to go to unreserved compartments if you had bought a second class ticket otherwise you will end up in paying fine or bribe to the train TC as we did.


Enough of general information, now lets get back to our story. So we finished our breakfast the next day morning at Jungle camp and we are late. It’s almost 8:30 am and we have a train to catch that is 42kms away. The roads are very curvy and you can’t take the risk of riding fast unless you are a skillful driver. We were lucky because we had one. So after saying a sad good bye to Pradhani village and the jungle camp, we rushed towards the castle rock station. We worked on the game plan on the way as this train was our only chance to visit the spectacular Dudhsagar falls and we didn't want to screw it up at any cost. It was already 10.15 am. Pressure was building up. Whether we could catch the train or not. Everything was decided.. who has to get down first? Who has to get the tickets? Who has to get the food for afternoon meal? Who has to take care of luggage? Finally we reached the station. We saw the train standing in the station about to leave. One instruction in our minds - RUN! We ran as if we were chased by mad dogs. :D


Seriously, the 90 minutes train journey you must experience it once in your life. The lush greenery forest and in the middle, you and the train. You just can't sit back and enjoy. You have to stand near the door and feel it. And please don't forget to shout whenever the train enters the tunnel. The train reached Dudhsagar station and we were welcomed by a big yellow board and an old watch tower which had almost reached it's end of life.


![http://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/img_0595.jpg](Finally at Dudhsgar)

You start walking in the direction of train for about 1 km and you can hear the noise of the mighty Dudhsagar. The railway track goes right in front of the waterfalls. When you go by the track you reach something like the middle of the falls. Either you can play there or you can decide to climb up or go down to the bottom of the waterfalls through a small path. But be careful as again there are chances of "COMPLETE  ಹೊಗೆ". We decidde to go down after taking some pics near the falls as our souvenir. After we reached the bottom of the falls we couldn't just wait to swim. We wore our swim attire and literally just placed a foot into the water. For a moment it's like a thousand volts jhatka. The water was bone chillingly cold even with sun directly at the top in a warm afternoon. If you just walk a little bit doing circus on the slippery rocks you will reach a big pond at the bottom of the falls where you can swim(You are not allowed to go down during monsoons). Even if you are the best swimmer in the world you have to wear a  life jacket otherwise the life guards won't allow you to swim. So disappointed we walked back to the place where we changed our dress. The water from the falls flows further to this place where the force will be less and you can enjoy safely. Fun unlimited is guaranteed here. It can't be explained in words. You have to experience it yourselves. You can even watch the train going on the bridge from bottom of the falls. That is when you realize that there is a masterpiece of engineering in between the nature's beauty. Kudos to all the people who have built that bridge. So now the clock is ticking almost 4 PM in the evening and we had one thought in mind - "Why the hell this time travels so fast? It used to be so much slow in our classrooms".. :P


![Dudhsagar falls and the train](http://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/img_0286.jpg)

So me, Vijesh and Vivek were forced to stop playing by our friends. So we changed and started moving towards the Dudhsagar station. As you walk towards the station the mighty falls hides itself behind the tress and vanishes from your line of sight. When you reach the station you will  realize that how many people have come there like you. A huge crowd of more than 300 people at least were there. Now it is a challenge for you to board the train back to Castle Rock station which by the way stops only for 2 minutes at Dudhsagar. You have to personally experience that joy and huge cheer we witnessed by the crowd when the train arrived at 5:30 PM. We had to push in people to get inside the train. We were back to Castle Rock by 6:10 PM and we were all set to come back to Namma Bengaluru. So there it was; the end of a spectacular journey to Dandeli and Dudhsagar. We reached Bengaluru in the early morning and prepared ourselves (mentally) for a busy life with schedules, meetings, code reviews and commits.

“Ladies and gentlemen, as we start our descent, please make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in upright position”, I woke up to the announcement as it was an early morning flight from Sydney to Melbourne. It took a moment for me to comprehend where I was and later I started staring out of the window to find beautiful lush green meadows, grazing cattle, well laid out roads and tiny houses. I began adoring the city right from this moment. As our flight landed, Nikhil persuaded me to put on my jacket saying it will be cold, but I resisted saying “Its ok, just a short walk into the airport, I’ll manage”. The minute I stepped out the aircraft I realized I can’t manage :D It was 10 degrees outside though sun was bright in the sky. This kind of gave me a taste of what the next 4 days of my trip would be like.

We had booked an Airbnb room in an inner suburb called Flemington. The public transportation in Melbourne is pretty neat, we dint have any issues reaching our destination. For newbies, the public transportation here works on something called your “Myki Pass”. You buy a Myki card for $6, top it up and you are good to go. We reached the house lugging our heavy bags, could locate it easily because of its distinct Victorian design. The owner had mailed me earlier saying she will be leaving the key at a designated spot. We found the key and when Nikhil was about to open the door, I screamed from behind saying “Btw, she had told me that there is going to be a dog in the house”. By then Nikhil had already opened the door and exclaimed “Oh damn, couldn’t you have told earlier, who knows how big it is”. We were still in the middle of our conversation, a tiny dog came and started dancing all around us. To our luck it was a very friendly dog and ended up becoming very good friends with us during our stay there.

We found our way into our room decided to leave the luggage there and set on to explore the city. As soon as we walked out, it had already become very cloudy and had started to rain! Though I had read that Melbourne experiences 4 seasons in a day, I had not expected it to be so drastic. We started our long walk from Flemington all the way to the CBD admiring the parks, trams, cars and the greenery on our way. Trams running on the middle of the road was something I saw for the first time and was quite thrilled about it.

Day 2:
Being a rainy day, the temperature was around 7-8 degrees outside but that dint effect our enthusiasm to step out and explore the city. We started our day at Queen Victoria Market, shopping for souvenirs, talking to the shopkeepers and eating some interesting “Spanish Donuts”. There are a lot of food options in this market and I would suggest everyone to try some. Melbourne is known for its art, culture and food which is quite apparent in their markets. You get to see a lot of quirky stuff here which kept me engrossed throughout.

From here we headed to the Federation Square which is one of the major landmarks of the city. Federation Square is a mixed-use development in the inner city of Melbourne and centered on three major public spaces – St. Paul's Court, The Square, and The Atrium.

The main highlight of the day was visiting St Kilda at dusk to meet the little penguins. The penguins come out on the rocks at the St Kilda Pier during sunset. A word of advice if you want to visit, do carry enough winter wear as it can get very cold here as the sun goes down the horizon. While we were waiting for the sunset, we met a local middle aged guy with whom we had a very interesting conversation about how he has been coming there since he was young and how things have remained the same in spite of all the changes. We were lucky to spot a baby penguin who was probably waking up from his sleep inside the rocks although we could not capture him in our camera as flash photography is now allowed here.

Day 3:
I was excited to see the sun out in the morning. This morning we had our breakfast while befriending the pets – Sharon, Fennigan and Kara. Adorable little creatures and extremely well mannered.

We took the tram from Flemington to the CBD and started walking towards the Melbourne Museum. The Carlton gardens on the way to the museum looked like one of the places described in Enid Blyton’s books which I used to adore reading as a kid. Looking at well laid out pathways, the lush green grass, the autumn-orange colored leaves of trees, tiny pools with ducks waddling around, we could not help but sit on a bench for some time to just soak it all in.

After a short walk from the Melbourne Museum, we were at the Parliament of Victoria which I was very keen to visit as they let you watch the sitting. But since it was a weekend, there was no sitting and Nikhil was quite disappointed to have overlooked this detail while planning out our itinerary. While he was contemplating on what to do next, I said “Come, I have a place in mind which I am sure will cheer you up!”
After a good 15 minute walk, with him mumbling about how he should have checked the details properly, we reached Lygon Street. This street is synonymous with the Italian community of Melbourne very popular for its street side Italian restaurants and alfresco cafes. We settled down on a street side table at the famous restaurant “Tiamo” (which I had researched in advance and had found that it serves delicious vegetarian food as well). After lunch I said “See I had told you this will cheer you up”. I remember him wiping his lips after all the pizza, tiramisu and hot chocolate saying “I had no idea I am this easy to please” :D :D

Took a short walk to the State Library of Victoria, which has public access. This is an enormous library with some painting exhibits, definitely worth a visit to see the enormous collection of books and people completely engrossed in reading. For all the not-so-book-lovers, there is free wifi access here :P
The last stop was at the Cook’s cottage which is housed in the Fitzroy Gardens. For all the dog lovers, this garden is a must visit place where pet owners bring their poodles for a stroll. The Cook’s cottage was constructed in 1755 in the English village of Great Ayton, North Yorkshire, by the parents of Captain James Cook and was brought to Melbourne in 1934 by Sir Russell Grimwade, as a part of a bid. The inside of the cottage includes centuries-old antiques and is stylised in the way of the 18th century, as are the clothes of the volunteer guides. We got to try some Victorian styled clothes as well, which was pretty cool.

Bidding adieu to this amazing place, the sadness of a vacation coming to an end, the joy of going back home with so many stories to share, the excitement to plan more vacations like this in the future were the thoughts in my mind while sitting on one of the benches at the docklands waterfront.

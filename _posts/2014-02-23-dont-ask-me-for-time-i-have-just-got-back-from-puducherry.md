This was during our great engineering days. After those last minute preparations for our 7<sup>th</sup> semester end exams and managing to jolt down something sensible on the answer sheet, it was time for us to take a break. I clearly remember, it was 7th of January 2013 and we 3 friends were avid for a trip, away from Bangalore, to some place where we can just relax and forget time. And what better place than "Puducherry", affectionately called "Pondi".

After a quick research on our destination and multiple attempts of trying to convince our parents to get their consent for this trip, we left by a KSRTC Volvo to Pondi. (We were just 3 in number. So a public transport was the best option). All excited, we chose to just talk and talk throughout the whole journey and not sleep.

We reached Pondi during the wee hours of morning. As soon as we laid our feet on Pondicherry, we were thronged by Autowalas. So we chose to get a ride from that autowalas who offered us the cheapest price. We directed the chosen autowala to take us to "Annai Residency". This Hotel offers good Non-AC rooms at very reasonable price compared to other hotels in Pondi. And for that sole reason, all the Non-AC rooms at Annai Residency were already booked and we were unable to get one. So we were forced to go for an AC room.  And yes, do not worry if you have no idea about what places to visit during your stay. Most hotels provide you a complete list of places to visit in Pondi. Very helpful I must say!

To roam around in Pondi, you could rent motorbikes/cycles or an auto-rickshaw. And the best idea in case of auto-rickshaw would be to catch hold of one the autowalas and call him every time you need a ride. Make him your official driver for the trip. Luckily for us, the autowala himself gave us his number so that we can call him in case we need any ride/drop. Indirectly he himself made him our official driver. :)

So...After having a yummy , typical south-indian, complimentary breakfast we decided to head to our first destination - Paradise Beach. We called the auto-wala who gave us our first morning ride. He was a good-hearted man, offered reasonable price and even better, he could understand the little Tamil we knew and would communicate well with the little English he knew. This made our trip easier, in a place where most people spoke in Tamil.

Journey to Paradise Beach took around 20 minutes. But to reach the actual spot we had to go by a Ferry. So they took us on a Ferry to a small island, which was named "Paradise Beach" and we were awed by the sight of it. It was breathtakingly beautiful and surprisingly VERY clean.

They usually allow you to play in this beach for a max of 3 hours, which is a fair enough time. There are also few security guards in the beach, who along with their security duty, make sure that we do not litter the beach. The Ferry journey also contains some good scenery around it.  After having a gala time at the beach, we headed back in the Ferry and walked towards our auto. By now the auto-wala had transformed into our good friend and we started referring him as auto-anna.  He suggested that we 3 go to "Chettinad" or "Appachi" for lunch. And hence we ended up in Appachi. For people who like spicy food, Appachi would be a good choice. The place is a little gloomy and dark, but thumbs up for the food.

Followed by a good nap, we headed towards "Promenade". This is the best place you can spend your evenings at. A long stretch along the beach with nice, wide roads, clean wide  pavements with French colonial style buildings on one side and Bay of Bengal on the other. You can just walk along the stretch, feeling the cool ocean breeze hit you smoothly or just sit on the stones, listening to songs and enjoying each and every attempt of  waves to climb those black stones and hit you.

It's just an amazing place to spend time, doing nothing. And the best part, vehicles are not allowed on this road after 6, giving away the whole road and pavement to the walkers. Also along the stretch there are lot of eateries.There is also this famous "Le Cafe" which mostly attracts the foreign crowd. The food is okay but the location for this restaurant is great.  After having an indelible time at Promenade we headed back to our rooms, closing our trip for the day.

On the 2nd day of our Pondi trip, we visited the Pondicherry Museum. Contains quite a good collection of paintings, various stuffs belonging to the French period and those belonging to various rulers of Pondi. Next we started exploring the streets of Pondi, which was a good decision by the way. The various French styled buildings in yellow gives you an momentary illusion that you are in France.

Loosing all our energy walking around in scorching heat, we decided to jump in for lunch. We went to "Surguru Pure Veg Restaurant" to re-energise ourselves. Good ambience, good starters/main course and yummy desserts. We had all our energy back. After lunch we visited the "Aurobindo Ashram". Nice, calm place but you will not spend much time here unless you are a spiritual seeker.  So we headed back to the streets of Pondi and found tiny road side shops in Nehru street where they were selling some good, in-fashion dresses on very reasonable prices. A girl can never say "no" for that :P .

Going further on the streets, we could see the amazing Promenade beach stretch from far . It hypnotized us to walk towards it and we did. Our previous evening at Promenade was just so pleasant that we decided to spend the rest of the evening at Promenade, again.

Auroville ashram is another place that you could visit.It has a gold plated "Mantrimandir" and a beach. But our auto-anna was charging around 250 for this journey. So we just scraped the plan.

Another very good alternative is a visit to "Mahabalipuram", which is approximately 98 kms from Pondi. There are buses that ply to Mahabalipuram from Pondi. A visit to Mahabalipuram will take your one whole day because there are lot of places that are worth seeing there, such as Shore temple, Pancha Ratha etc etc.


Anyway coming back to Promenade.  We spent our last evening on the Promenade beach again. We'd say a trip to Pondicherry would be incomplete without an evening at Promenade. We had our bus to Bangalore at 10 and it was 6 already.So we were just about to leave Promenade when we noticed a T-shirt at Le-Cafe with the wordings "Don't ask me for time, I have just got back from Puducherry" and we bought it right away.

As one last stop, we visited "Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus" which had   quite a pleasant Gothic architecture. Since we were running late, we quickly headed back to our rooms, packed our bags, had our dinner and then called up our friend auto-anna to drop us  to the bus stand.Bidding goodbye to auto-anna   at bus stand, we realized that our 2 day trip  was coming to an end which made   us all unhappy. Just so that we don't forget the 2 amazing  days we had in Pondi, I had sketched an outline of what we did in this trip on a thin card- board  just before leaving the room.

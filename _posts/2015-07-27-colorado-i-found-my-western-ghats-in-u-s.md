The very first driving factor that strengthened my decision of doing Masters in US was the idea of travelling in a foreign country and explore new places. Sure, I would have done that otherwise too. But living here and exploring the country as a resident is a whole lot of different experience. When I first got here, everything seemed so organized. The lanes, neatly groomed bushes, paved paths without the traces of soil on them, neatly maintained lush green lawns - all of this was "different" for me. I missed the chaos of my motherland. I missed the rawness of the nature. The smell of the soil, the rocky paths, the crowd, the tender fragrance of the flowers, the warmth of the tea in the rain under the misty western ghats watching the stall person frying out the hot pakodas from the oil - I missed all of it and I thought I would miss it for a long time. But Colorado made me feel at home. It made me fall in love with the mountains here, taught me that being organised is not that bad after all, the smell in the air brought a sense of comfort. The travel bud in me had found its nourishment. :)

My extended Sancharaa family here at U.S, planned for a much needed break. We were sure that we wanted to visit a scenic place and Colorado topped the list. Planning for a trip in a foreign land was my first experience and quite an exciting one. For us students, money was another factor. We had to carefully plan the trip so as to keep our expenses low. The budget was decided. 300$ it was!

We booked a flight in Spirit airlines(Cheapest domestic flight here). We were 7 in number and Spirit doesn't allow cabin baggage without paying for it. 25$ per bag :O Instead we booked 2 check-in baggage and it was around 7$ per head. Jugaad works! Money saved is money earned.

Next challenge was the accommodation. Since it's a tourist place, the hotels/lodges were no less than 140$ per night per room that could accommodate 4 members. Seemed unrealistic. We looked for other options and we were blessed with <strong>AirBnB -</strong> "Find hosts with extra rooms, entire homes, and unique accommodations like castles and igloos". I think you now have a fair idea about what they do. They have localhosts(no pun intended) around the country who have extra rooms/entire place to rent out for a day/week/month. The homes are fully furnished and have basic amenities. Food was no more a problem. On the way from Denver airport to our first accommodation, we stopped by Walmart and India bazaar and got some frozen parathas, ready-to-eats, eggs, milk, cereals. We were all set for the trip!

Without further ado, I will list out the itinerary.

<strong>Day 0:</strong> Driving down to Colorado will be awesome if you stay somewhere close by. I would recommend you to take flight in case if the drive is more than 4 hours because there is SO much to do once you get there.
<em>*Quick tip*: Take a flight to Denver and then drive to Colorado Springs. It'll save you a lot of money.</em>
Renting a car has never been this easy (Enterprise). Once you land, find an exit to rental cars' shuttle service. Keep your Driver's license and confirmation number ready. 15 minutes and you are done!

<strong>Day 1:</strong> Mt. Cutler trail + Helen hunt falls + Garden of gods.
<strong>Mt. Cutler trail (6800ft):</strong> A beautiful 1 mile trail leading you to the top of the peak. Await a breathtaking view of the Colorado springs. Spot seven falls on the way to the peak top. Hike difficulty: Moderate (1.5 hour)
<strong>Helen hunt falls:</strong> A beautiful waterfalls. Hike for 1 mile to get to the head of the falls. Water is fierce and be careful. (1 hour)
<strong>Garden of Gods:</strong> Gigantic orange rock formations. Look out for the board to know what you have to look for. "Kissing camels" is one of the prominent one.

A 21 mile drive to the hill top. The sight of snow capped mountains makes you want to go there even more. While it is summer in the rest of the world, you get to beat the heat at Colorado. Make sure you carry your shades. The super bright white snow can actually get a little irritating after a while. At the 13th mile, there is a small store and a coffee shop. Sipping hot chocolate while feeling the cold breeze was an experience no less than drinking hot tea in misty cold Western Ghats. Nature has its own little ways to remind you of home in a foreign land. Quite an artist, isn't it?! :) We spend about 3 hours here and then drove to Silverthorne. Just when you think that it can't get any more beautiful, you land in a place which leaves you in awe. All you want to do is watch out of the window and sink it all in, enough for a lifetime. We reached Silverthorne and stayed at our second accommodation. Sitting by the fireplace, chit-chatting about random things and looking at the snow fall - that's how our night ended.

<strong>Day 3: </strong>Drive to Glenwood Springs + Hanging Lake
All geared up for the next destination. Although we had a good night's sleep, we still missed that "5 minutes" of sleep. It was a 90 mile drive to the Hanging Lake. All of us had decided that we would take a nap in the car. The journey started. Trust me when I say this - We couldn't close our eyes for a moment! The entire drive was so beautiful. It was like a painting and we were wanderers who wanted to get lost in the colors of Mother Nature. The Glenwood's grand canyon is something to look for. Makes you feel like tiny creatures in front of the gigantic rock formations.

We reached our destination after a breathtaking 90-mile drive. Hanging Lake. It started drizzling as if it were to welcome us. What we expected was a beautiful waterfall. What we got was a 1.5 mile difficult hike to the falls. A waterfall on a mountain?! Mindf**cked :D We were more excited now. The rocky path made the hike real difficult. The rain made it worse. We wore our winter jackets to keep us warm. But then, who knew we would sweat during the hike. Who knew that though the distance was 1.5 mile, the elevation was crazy. Who knew that the mushy mud path was enough to trick us into falling down. I had found my chaos, the rawness, the smell of the soil - all that I had missed, the one that I had been longing for - Western Ghats! :')

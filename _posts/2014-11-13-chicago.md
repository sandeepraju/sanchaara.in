<p style="text-align:justify;">With more than half the sancharaa team in India, I was feeling pretty lonely. I guess someone up there sensed my loneliness, one of them got an opportunity to fly to US :D There was no looking back. The 4 of us decided on where could we meet, coordinated with the date, timings and place. Within a span of one hour, tickets were booked. One was supposed to fly from New York and the other two from Dallas to meet a friend in Chicago. :D And all this happened over Google Hangouts. Technology strikes again! Noticed something different from the rest of our other trips?! Yeah, that's right. There was NO PLANNING! It was totally dynamic. Probably it was the joy of meeting my friend after a year and a half that did not let me think twice about the trip.</p>

The day finally arrived. Boarded the plane. It was 2 and half hour journey. I looked out of the window and the view was breathtaking. Vijay had come to pick us up. It had been a year and a half and I still shared the same comfort level. Probably that's the beauty of friendship. The feeling of being in Chicago slowly sunk in and oh boy! that felt awesome. :)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We started with Cloud gate, affectionately called "The Bean". The Bean is the main tourist attraction present in the Millennium park. It is famous for the way it looks and its extremely polished exterior that reflects the city's skyline. It is beautiful to look into it and make faces. :D Luckily, we even got to attend a RedBull Can Art Exhibition and sip a free redbull ;)  We walked in the Millenium street and got back home. That was the end of the first day.</p>

After spending an awesome time at I-wont-mention-where-because-that's-our-next-blog-post, our hero was here in Chicago to explore with us :D The four of us set out on our very first spot, the <strong>Shedd Aquarium</strong> *drum rolls* :D It is not just another aquarium. It is a whole different world. It is mesmerizing. It is vast. It is beautiful! :) You get to see turtles, piranhas, Beluga whales, dolphins, seal, corals, anemones and a hundred sub-species of that. My favorite were the Jelly fishes. They are venomous, yet so beautiful. Their movement is so mesmerizing that you can't take your eyes off them. One more favorite Do not miss the Dolphin and Seal's show. The show is called One World! They are just adorable. Bottomline - Shedd is an ecosystem in itself!

<strong>Skydeck Chicago.</strong>

Imagine you are taken to 103rd floor of a building in a lightning speed lift. The pressure difference starts acting upon you. You have pain in your ears. The lift stops. "Freedom" is the word you utter! You step out of the lift, look through the crystal clear glass windows and there are you are, standing, witnessing the beauty of an urban city, fully lit majestic buildings, neatly arranged glittering like gold pearls. Look down and you can see a number of fireflies look-alikes - yes, that's right! Cars moving around. Man has indeed been successful in making man-made structures look beautiful.

A little more on Chicago life...

The make of the city - Chicago popularly known as "City of lights" is rightly called so. The downtown is a lively place with lots of tourists flowing in. This place is an amalgamation of new and old buildings. If the new ones showcase a lot of glass-built buildings, the old ones highlight the heritage of the city. At every intersection of 2 roads, at least one of the corner will have a Starbucks. Probably that is why 1 in 2 people will have a coffee cup in their hand.

Public transport - Chicago has an awesome public transport. The subways are really helpful. Pay once, and you can reach your destination no matter how many times you change lines. By "Lines" I mean, different routes. Each of these lines are color coded and run in a specific predefined route. Each station has a ticket vending machine. You can swipe your card or put in cash to buy tickets. There are passes as well. These passes let you travel either in bus or the train. How cool is that!

People - They are considerate. They have a smile on their faces. If you are trying to click a selfie, there are people who come and offer to click a pic of yours. This happened to us over 10-12 times. So yeah! they are definitely sweet. Although look out for rash drivers. You might almost lose your life :D

Weather - Extremely chilly during winters. The winds make it worse. Make sure you have covered yourself up if you plan to go in winter.

Tips:
If you are in Chicago for 4-5 days and plan to cover most of the famous places, it is better to buy a City pass which costs around 90$. Without this, it costs almost double of this. Plus this pass ensures VIP entry to every place. This way, you don't have to wait in long queues.
<a href="https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_8278.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-260" src="https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_8278.jpg?w=750" alt="IMG_8278" width="750" height="500" /></a>

Take subways to travel. It is called <strong><em>Chicago Transit Authority</em></strong>. Renting a car is not necessary. All the tourist attractions are 5 minutes walk from each other. Even otherwise, you can take subways to connect to each other. They are comfortable.

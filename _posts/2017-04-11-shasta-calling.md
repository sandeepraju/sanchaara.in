Hello Spring! 

<b>0. Going to the </b>
It is exciting to travel to some place new. But this time, we decided to visit Mt. Shasta again! Something about the last visit to Shasta resonated with me. After all, I enjoy re-watching a TV series and re-reading a book, so why not travel to the same place, again.

<b>1. The Drive</b>
We drove from San Jose to Shasta city via Redding. It is about a 5 hour scenic drive covering 300 miles. Leave early to enjoy the sunrise, tuning into some good music.

<b>2. Exploring the waterfalls</b>
During my previous visit I had fallen in love with Burney falls! It is beautiful. McArthur-Burney State Park's famous attraction is the waterfalls. A short trail leads to an amazing view of the falls. Burney roared with the sound of thundering water. We were soaked even before we reached the foot of the falls. After spending about an hour here we headed out to Mc Cloud falls. There are three parts of this waterfalls - Upper, Middle and the Lower. An easy trail follows along the river connecting the three view points. Canyons are carved out by the fierce river. The lower falls is a popular picnic spot. When the water level is optimum the lower falls is suitable for cliff jumping. This is a typical view of the lower falls packed with the crowd in Summer.

<b>3. Open for surprises!</b>
Castle Lake is a glacial lake located in the Siskiyou County. It is about a 10 mile drive from Lake Siskiyou. I remember we had a good time swimming here over the last Summer. I suggested on going to this place and hangout over the evening. I knew the water would be cold, and that swimming would generally be limited to Summer. 

But this was defintely not what I expected! A frozen lake! Wish I could freeze this moment..

The layer of ice formed on the lake was thick enough to bear our weight. We moved about looking for cracks, if any. This was by far the best view during this trip. There was something about the tranquil white frozen lake and the stunning mountains and the trees around. We got curious to dig out the ice at a safe spot to find the water underneath it. We spent the rest of the evening here until sunset and headed to our accomodation. Lake Siskiyou camp grounds in Shashta is an ideal place to camp. 

<b>5. Explore<b>
Inspired by this <a href="http://ijpr.org/post/mossbrae-forbidden-falls-dunsmuir#stream/0">post</a> we set out to explore Mossbrae falls, one of the hidden areas in Dunsmuir. It is quiet tricky to find this waterfalls. To reach this place, one has to park outside the Shasta Retreat and it about 1.2 miles hikes from here. Walk down the Scarlett Ave and take a right turn. Take a right agian at the bridge and walk along the railway track. As suggested in the other blogs, it is advised to keep towards the right of the track, and walk along the river. The trains are in operation. There is plenty of place to stand aside if a train comes in. We were lucky to spot a train. A lot of people do this hike though it is forbidden. It is worth the hike. We spent about an hour enjoying the waterfalls and then headed back. We had planned on visiting the Shasta caves, but we were short of time. It is a 2 hour guided tour to the caves and closes at 5pm. So make sure you reach there atleast by 3pm.

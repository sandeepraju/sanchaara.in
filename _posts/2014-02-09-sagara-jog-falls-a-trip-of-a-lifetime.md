I must say I haven't explored a lot of places within Karnataka. Out of the ones I've been to, I've found places in and around Shimoga district to be the best. The beauty of Malenadu is best experienced during monsoon. I had a wonderful opportunity to visit the region during the peak of Monsoon 2013. It was a trip of a lifetime!

Why? I'll explain in a jiffy. Watch this video. Its a compilation video from my trip. I'd like to dedicate it to Namma Malenaadu, Photographers, Cyclists and World Photography Day.

The day is August 14th, 2013. Imagine you're a photographer, a wannabe cyclist and you love to get drenched in the rain. Oh.. and lets not forget your love for chocolates. It hasn't even been a week since you've bought your brand new 55-250mm lens and a new bike. World Photography Day is just four days away. Out of the blue, you get this brilliant idea to go on a cycling trip from Sagara to Jog Falls and back (approx 70 kms).. during the peak of monsoon! And the next thing you know, you're on your way. Little do you know that the monsoon this year was a lot heavier than usual.

And what happens next? The back brake of your cycle breaks while transporting the cycle from Bangalore to Sagara. Tough luck, kid! Did I mention you were going all alone? No? ok. You're going all alone! And what do you decide to carry in your back pack? Just 3 lenses, a camera body, a tripod and umm.. a couple pair of clothes.

You're lucky to have relatives' places along the path though. One, you get time to rest and two, you get to explore the locality and take pictures. You set your eyes on Jog Falls and head towards it. The onward journey turns out to be amazing! A downhill ride and showers every now and then. But somehow, you manage to capture some snaps and shoot a couple of videos.. while riding on your bike. (psst.. you're all alone, remember? someone has to shoot, and thats you!)

The return journey is more thrilling. You're already late, because you were waiting for the clouds to clear up and get a glimpse of the mighty Jog Falls. On your way back, you notice a bus that wasn't supposed to be on your route. Next, you notice your lecturer's home town, which is still not supposed be on your route. Something looks fishy. Oh wait! you have missed a turn and ended up cycling 3 kms uphill, in the wrong direction! You lose more time and get back to the right path. Remember the calm downhill path you took on your way to Jog Falls? Its the other way round now.

So.. lets get the facts straight. You're riding uphill on your brand new bicycle through the heavy monsoon rains, without a back brake, completely drenched, with your brand new lens in a heavy and sensitive back pack and you're exhausted. But hey, thats what you asked for! Now, you stop your bike at a view point, stand at the edge of a platform, admire the pouring rains and pull out a bar of chocolate. Aah.. bliss!

You call it a day and head home for the night. The next day, you pack things up and leave for Sagara. Whats equally interesting is the astonished look on the faces of the passers-by.. priceless I tell you, priceless! You wonder how crazy they might think you are. These are some of the moments one has to live for! Sorry to zap you back to reality, but you've got a bus to catch in the night, and you've to head to work the morning, pronto!

And now you know why I call it a trip of a lifetime, my lifetime at least.

ಅಚ್ಚ ಮಲೆನಾಡಿನ ಅಬ್ಬರ ಮಳೆಯಲ್ಲೊಂದು ನಾಲ್ಕು ದಿನದ ಪಯಣ.. ನಾನು, ನನ್ನ ಸೈಕಲ್ಲು, ನನ್ನ ಕ್ಯಾಮೆರಾ.. ಆಹಾ, ಎಂತಹ ಮಧುರಾನುಭವ ಅಂತೀರಾ, ಅದರ ಸವಿಯನ್ನು ಸವಿದವನೇ ಬಲ್ಲ!!

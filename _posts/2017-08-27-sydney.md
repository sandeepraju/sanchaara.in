Sitting at the doorstep of the locked apartment, I began mentally calculating the time back in India and what I would be doing on a typical Sunday afternoon. My panic mode was “On” as I felt stranded in a new continent, my first time outside India. 

This being my first trip outside India, I was naturally apprehensive and had taken utmost care about all the bookings, But I had missed out having a last conversation with my Airbnb host about the door number and how to collect my keys from him while he was not home. My husband Nikhil being the usual calm person he is, had started looking out for alternate arrangements to stay. Nikhil was trying his best to calm me down saying he will arrange something while my sister was on call with me the whole time saying “Chill Sup, these things happen”, until we finally managed to contact the host and get our issue resolved. So my first and foremost tip to anyone travelling, make sure all your communications are complete before u start your trip!!

<b>Day 2</b>

The next day we began our city exploration by taking a bus to the Museum station. Though Sydney offers a lot of options of guided tours we were very particular about exploring the city on our own, mostly by foot. You can buy the opal card (for the public transportation) in any of the 7-eleven store in the city, top it up and you are all set to explore!!
It was a typical Monday morning with people dressed in their winter coats and boots holding their morning coffee in one hand and a newspaper in another hurriedly pacing on the sidewalks of the streets. This felt to me like an opening scene of some movie I had watched recently. While I was busy admiring the high rise buildings and the people around me, I missed a pedestrian signal and stepped on the street while it turned from green to red. The Bangalorean in me was mentally preparing to hear a driver scream at me while I actually saw a car driver say sorry and let me walk by!! I was truly amazed by the road manners here, while Nikhil worriedly came to me as I crossed the street and said “admiring the city is ok Sup, but you should be careful and more aware of your surroundings. Don’t be in your own world. Idu Jayanagara alla :D”.

Took some pictures at the Pool of reflection and Anzac memorial and started walking into the Hyde Park which is Sydney’s oldest public park. Though the Hyde park in Sydney is not as vast as the one in UK, I found the pathways very inviting on a chilly morning. We walked past the St Mary’s Cathedral as it was closed for public on that particular day and started strolling down the path through the Royal Botanical Gardens towards Mrs. Macquaire’s Chair. This is an exposed sandstone rock cut into the shape of a bench, on a peninsula in Sydney Harbour, hand carved by convicts from sandstone for Governor Macquarie's wife Elizabeth. In the modern day this place is one of the very few places from where you can get a good view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera house together. As we were walking through the Royal botanical gardens, we got a glimpse of the Opera house and immediately decided to walk to this gigantic monument directly with major FOMO, skipping the photo stop at Mrs. Macquaire’s chair.

Opera house is a performing arts centre of Sydney and one very interesting fact I got to know about this monument is that it is cooled using seawater taken directly from the harbor! I had seen this monument in every possible picture and postcard related to Australia, but actually being there in front of it was a totally different feeling. You start feeling puny in front of the massive structure which is symbolic of the whole continent. We started feeling hungry when we saw all the cafes lining the harbor and began looking for a safe veg option. We settled on a bench at the Circular Quay with a sub and I was back to admiring the waterfront, Sydney Harbor bridge and the Opera house from a distance. Since it was lunch time the place was filled with people having their lunch and taking their afternoon jog. This was probably another interesting thing I observed about the Sydneysiders (yup! That’s what they are called!!). Many of them are fitness freaks, you can spot a lot of people jogging, skateboarding, surfing or simply working out in many public areas or parks. I remember mumbling something to Nikhil about how he should be more inspired from these people about fitness while he missed half of my speech digging into his foot-long sub :D

Next on our list was the Sydney observatory which we reached after walking through a neighborhood called “The Rocks” which is perhaps the city’s oldest historical area with numerous stalls of fashion accessories, art, craft, jewelry and cafes.

The entire locality had an old town feel with the stone buildings, delicious smell of coffee and baked goodies and good music played by local artists on their guitars and banjos. After a small climb up the hill we were awestruck by this breathtaking view!!

This is a perfect place to take pictures of the Sydney Harbor Bridge from an unconventional angle or to just relax in the sunshine on the freshly cut green grass and gaze at the mighty city. We decided to take the day tour of the observatory where we were guided by an experienced astronomer, Nathalie who explained us in detail about the constellations. We were even lucky to spot Alpha Centauri A and its neighbor Alpha Centauri B (Not sure if I got the names right, forgot to take down notes in all the excitement!) though one of their telescopes. Since it was a weekday, we were one of the few people there. It is advisable to pre-book if you are visiting on weekends or for any of their night tours.

<b>Day 3</b>

I looked out of the apartment window early in the morning and saw a rainy and gloomy Sydney, opened the weather app for confirmation that it was going to be an overcast day and woke up Nikhil to proudly tell him that I was not crazy that had packed umbrellas :D 

We started our day by taking a walk from Ultimo (the neighborhood where we had stayed) to the famous Darling Harbor in the drizzle. Nikhil pointed to some vehicles slowly moving on the flyover and said “Sup, google maps says that’s a traffic jam. Cute no!!” :D On the way we happened to come across a place called Chinese Garden of Friendship. Clicked some pictures and continued our walk towards the harbor. One can probably spend a whole day in this harbor doing a lot of typical touristy stuff as the Madam Tussauds, Sydney Marine life, Sydney zoo are all located here, not to mention the numerous cafes and restaurants lining the harbor walk way.  This is also a famous place to watch the new year fireworks. We decided to skip the overcrowded tourist places and walked all the way to the end of the harbor while admiring the docked boats.

We took a ferry from the Barangaroo wharf to the cockatoo island which is named after a white bird. Though we dint get to spot any cockatoos there, it was a beautiful island which is also a UNESCO world heritage site. It was Australia's biggest shipyards, operating between 1857 and 1991. Between 1839 and 1869, Cockatoo Island operated as a convict penal establishment, primarily as a place of secondary punishment for convicts who had re-offended in the colonies. In the present day it is a camping site where you can pre-book and enjoy a night here under the numerous stars. Since this place looks abandoned and is deserted most of the time, there are a lot of ghost themed events which are conducted here like the Haunted history night tour and Ghosts of Biloela. We did not have time to try any of this but if I get a chance would love to try it next time we visit!! There are a couple of restaurants on the island where you can get your lunch.

The ferry to the island itself is good experience, though it’s a very short journey they let you sit out on the deck and you can get a good view of the Harbor bridge with the light breeze in your hair while watching the posh houses on the other side with their private yatches.

After returning to the wharf we decided to take a stroll in the Barangaroo Reserve. This is a very recent park / entertainment space which was opened to public in 2015 running over a number of levels with panoramic views of the Sydney Harbor. It has separate cycle paths and walkways and again I could spot a lot of people working out here. There are various indoor events and exhibitions conducted with many food trucks parked outside. I personally felt it was every bit worth the hype!!

<b>Day 4</b>

It was a sunny day and we were very excited as it was our day at the famous Bondi beach!! This beach is every visitor’s favourite destination so I was secretly hoping that it should not be over crowded. To my luck it wasn’t or my definition of “crowded” is simply different :D 

We took a bus from the Ultimo main road and headed to the beach. This route is quite unique as you go through a lot of Sydney’s residential neighborhoods, with beautiful houses and super clean streets. The Bondi beach junction is just a few minutes walk from the beach. The beach itself reminded me of some postcard/ poster with white sand, clear blue water, green grass, joggers on the side walk and sea gulls struggling to fly due to the wind. There is a 6 km walkway here from the Bondi beach along the coast all the way till the Coogee beach. It is highly recommended provided you have the time and energy for it.

Though we had only 4 days in Sydney we explored quite a few places in a very relaxed manner, by skipping most places where we would have to stand in long queues. Definitely would want to go back to this city at some point of time to explore more! 


**Trip duration:**  4 days, 4 nights.

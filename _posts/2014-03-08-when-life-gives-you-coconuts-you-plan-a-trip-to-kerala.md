<span style="line-height:1.5em;">One evening at home - </span>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mom: I'm bored.
Me: I'm bored too. So yayy! lets go on a trip.
...and so it happened. Next was to decide upon a place. I wanted to go to Kerala for all the hype it had got. I was prepared for an argument with one strong point - my aunt stayed there. This made it easy to trick my parents into agreeing to my suggestion. :cool: Victory! Unanimous decision was to go to Kerala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The complete trip was from 2nd Jan - 9th Jan. We boarded a train on 2nd Jan in Majestic to Thrisshur, Kerala. Reached Thrisshur the next morning. After endless chit chats over the dining table, it was time to hog.  After an authentic Kerala meal, we set out to explore the small city. Every street had a scenic touch to it. The small temples alongside the lakes were decorated with diyas that enhanced its beauty even more. Divine is the word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4th Jan, 2013.</strong>
We rented a 4 seater car for the next 3 days of journey within Kerala. One of my cousin joined us. At around 8'o clock we started from Thrisshur after having a sumptuous breakfast at my aunt's place. We stopped at Kalady, the place where Shankaracharya was born. A beautiful 8 storeyed temple that has Adi Shankara's story inscribed on the walls of the spiral interior.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Next stop was Munnar, one of the popular town situated on the Kannan Devan(sounds familiar?) hills in South India located in Idukki district of Kerala. It was 2 in the afternoon when we reached there. Our car broke down on a narrow road that led to Attukad waterfalls. The funny part was, the driver, a friend of my uncle who was the guide for the rest of our journey did not know Hindi and we did not know Malayalam. My dad tried to converse with him in Kannada with a Malayalam accent - I still dont know what exactly was my dad's strategy :P Thanks to my cousin who managed to make both the teams understand what was happening. At the end of the trip, she was all exhausted being a translator and chose to turn deaf ears to the rest of the conversation. Well, that's a completely different story. Anyway, why I brought this little problem of ours was to emphasize on how kind are Keralites. A gentleman led us to his cottage, beautifully placed amidst the hills, a faint music of the water flowing in the background - made me feel that life was perfect. His family offered us water and gave us tips on what to visit and what not to. Munnar in Malayalam means "A land of 3 rivers" - gyaan by locals at Munnar. While I, my cousin and my mom enjoyed the beauty of the place, my dad and driver fixed the car. We had lunch. I prefer not to add any superlative adjectives describing the quality of food. We stayed at a small hotel called Munnar gardens. After a moment of relaxation, we headed out to explore the place in the evening and what awaited us was this -</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Echo point</strong> surrounded by trees with a lake in between. It is said that a voice echoes for 7 times in this place. Crowded with tourists, this place has a lot of shops. Spicy peanuts, cotton candy, home made chocolates and soft toys are the majority commodities. (Sounds like a history lesson..eh? :P) You also get to do a horse ride for Rs.20.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Mattupetty dam. Whatte beauty! We were so busy in enjoying the view that we did not click any pictures here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rose park on the way back to hotel was another attraction. Fresh air, sunset, flowers and the people you love - a perfect evening. Mind you, this closes at 5.15pm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5th Jan, 2013.</strong>
What makes Munnar so scenic are its Tea plantations. There is a tea museum for the interested ones which explains the complete lifecycle of the tree leaves and its different types. There is also a video shown to the visitors that speaks about the history of Munnar and how the tea plantations came into existence there. At the exit, you get to sip free tea provided at the museum.</p>
<a href="http://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/img_2722.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-186 aligncenter" alt="IMG_2722" src="http://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/img_2722.jpg?w=750" width="750" height="562" /></a>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bidding a good bye to Munnar, we next headed towards Alleppy, mainly to experience the Kerala backwaters. If you ask me "Does it look anything close to those pictures from Google?" I say, "Absolutely yes!" Every bit of it is filled with so much beauty that it makes you feel that nature is a true artist to carefully place everything in right proportions. It was a boat ride of a lifetime that lasted for 2 full hours. It costed us Rs. 1000 plus a pic with white headed eagle *free free free* :D There are people who come here solely to stay over night in the House boat which costs around Rs. 10000 that lets a maximum of 10 people. Authentic Kerala fish food is served for meals. Best part is, the fishes are caught right there, out of the backwaters. Sleep peacefully while the river sings a lullaby to you :) After the boat ride, we rushed to the Alleppy beach to spend the rest of the evening there. Sunset was beautiful. The waves of the beach kissing your legs..there's nothing like it :)</p>

After a tiring day, we halted at one of the udupi hotels in Kochi. Decent room and a cat to keep us entertained.
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6th Jan, 2013.</strong>
<strong>Fort Kochi</strong>, a cheerful region filled with tourists is bound by water. Fishing is a common sight here. <strong>St.Francis church</strong> was all decorated with ribbons and balloons since it was just a week after Christmas. Vasco-da-gama's tomb is in this Church. <strong>Jewish synagogue</strong> is another place. More than the place, the shops in the street leading to the synagogue catches your attention.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A trip is not a trip unless you visit a waterfall. :cool: Attirapally waterfalls - yeah baby! :D
There's a lot to walk. So make sure you have had a good meal. You reach the head of the falls. Walk more to reach the foot of the falls. And there you are witnessing nature's beauty in its highest form. :) Watch out for the monkeys though :P I will let the picture do the talking.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Its for a reason they call it a God's own country and what's the reason - Well, can't help you here. You have to experience it yourself :)</p>

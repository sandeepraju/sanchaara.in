It was a typical Monday morning in office while having our morning coffee my colleague Anusha said “I am planning to go for a trek in the Himalayas in the month of May. The place is called Har Ki Dun”. May be it was the monotony of the city life or mere excitement to explore a new place, I started researching about the location. After a good amount of Googling, I decided to join her. Meanwhile 2 other friends Ashwini and Srikanth were interested too. Hence we were a group of 4 and our Whatsapp group was formed (I think in recent days this can be taken as the sign of something becoming official) ☺ 
It was in the mid of May, we started our journey from Bangalore with a lot of excitement of going to the Himalayas for the first time in our lives while there was also a lot of anxiety in the back of our minds. Is there going to be a snow storm like what Google weather is forecasting? ,will this raincoat be sufficient, will I be able to carry my luggage?, would I be able to trek for 45-50 kms???..... Innumerable confusions of a first time trekker!

<b>Pahaadi breakfast, motion sickness and the zig zag roads  (Day 0):</b>

The very punctual bunch of people that we are, we were at the Dehradun railway station at sharp 7:00 in the morning lugging our trek bags looking for our pickup vans which would take us to a place called Sankri which was supposed to be the starting point of our trek. After some looking around, we found the tempo waiting for us. To our surprise there were 3 guys more punctual than us who were already seated in the front row of the vehicle! Before we started acquainting ourselves with these guys by sharing some breakfast, we were on the road via Mussourie. This route along the Yamuna river is by far the most intricate ghat section I have ever come across and the driver added to our fears of motion sickness :D After numerous efforts of trying to catch on lost sleep, head aches and constant hurling of my cab mates we had reached Govind Wildlife National Park, which is in the Sankri Ranges of Uttarakhand. The cool breeze as we reached Sankri was very welcoming, so were the chai and pakodas served by our trek team.

We all were made to assemble in a room for a short briefing session where we met with our to-be buddies for the next 5 days. Without any internet or phone connectivity, these 18 people were all that I was  going to have around me, in the Himalayan wilderness for the next few days! Trust me it really felt a bit strange at that moment.

<b>Gadwaali songs, the deathly jeep ride and my first tent experience (Day 1):</b>

Next morning we were all up by 6 as none of us wanted to miss the hot chai in the freezing weather. (I call it freezing though it was 12-14 degrees as I had no clue what was in store for me later in this trek). After a good breakfast, we hopped on the jeeps arranged for us to reach Taluka village. The jeep ride was amazing in itself. I was really scared to look down the steep cliffs just off the narrow roads which our driver was negotiating in a very casual manner playing some local Gadwali songs. After a while I found that the best way to fight the acrophobia was to sing along the tunes he was playing though we had no clue what that was :D There was one guy in our team who even said that he spotted a bear on the way to take our mind off the deathly valleys :P

Our trek began at Taluka village where we picked up our backpacks and walking sticks and began our journey. On this day we were supposed to complete a 12 km trek which included gradual ascents and descents. As lunch time was drawing closer, the sun was right above our head and I was well behind everyone in the team. If I have to confess outrightly, I was slower than many others and had ignored the clock rounds completely. The sun had set while we reached our first campsite – Pauni Garat where we enjoyed our time by the river side and had a sound sleep in our tents ; thanks to the day long walk and the sound of gushing water from the Supin river which put us to sleep.

<b>Steeper ascents, green meadows and the beauty of music: (Day 2)</b>

By now I had realized what I had signed up for. Though the distance to be covered for this day was mere 8 km, I noticed that the route not only grew steeper but also the height of each step that I was taking had increased. Although it was a hot and sunny day, the cold breeze kept our energy alive. After a couple of hours of panting and sipping glucose, we had reached our first stop for the day. It was a lush green meadow with cattle grazing. This was probably my most favorite spot in the whole trek. I just wanted to sit there and stare at the mountains for eternity. After a quick maggi stop here we resumed our ascent and stopped for lunch at a cliff where we found a fellow trekker singing a melodious harmony in sync with his shruti pettige (I have no idea what this is called in English!). The music echoing against the backdrop of the glorious Himalayas was truly mesmerizing. By sunset we had reached the Kalkatiyadhar campsite. This was probably the day when we all broke the ice (Thanks to our initiator Anup and non availability of mobile network) and started interacting with each other in the dinner tent.

<b>The gateway to heaven – Har Ki Dun : (Day 3)</b>

After yesterday’s steep climbs, I had made a routine for myself to stop after 20-25 steps to catch my breath and hydrated myself regularly. I must say that this actually helped me to walk consistently without taking any major breaks on day 3. Today’s path was much smoother with gradual ascents. We even crossed a small patch of pine forest with chirping birds and fluttering butterflies which invited us to the gateway to heaven – “Har Ki Dun”. As soon as we reached this place, each person’s natural instinct of appreciating nature kicked in. While few were posing for photos, the photographers in the group wandered around looking for a best spot to capture the beauty of the snow clad mountains, yet another group rejoiced the accomplishment of reaching our destination with a small dance performance while few others just sat down on the green grass staring in awe at the mighty Himalayas. In the evening the temperature dropped to 2-3 degrees (I suppose) and we were lucky enough to spot a hail stone rain from our dining tent. The experience of sipping hot and spicy soup while enjoying the company of amazing people looking at the immortal Swargarohini peak, beneath the sparkling stars is something that cannot be put in words.

<b>The Descent (Day 4):</b>

The next morning we began our descent amidst the cold winds. Though the descent was tricky and a couple of us took few falls, we managed to reach a small village – Osla by late afternoon. This village was very different from the others in terms of the wooden houses with tiny doors, stone thatched roofs and beautiful wooden temples. We were all amused by the fact that all the buildings here we built with materials brought on mules or humans themselves!! The descent from Osla to Pauni Garat was much steeper and scarier. I had to take help of my team mates to avoid any more falling for the day :D

<b>The last leg (Day 5):</b>

After a long 13 km descent on the previous day, my legs were full of cramps. I was facing difficulty in walking the easiest gradients as well. Again with some help from my friend, I was able to manage and maintain the pace with everyone else in the group. After a good 10 km walk we were at Taluka and a sense of sadness that the trek was going to be over soon started creeping in while there was also a sense of accomplishment that we completed the whole trek.

<b>The Closing credits (Day 6):</b>

After a photo session with the whole group (With the doggo  photo-bombing us) we finally sat down in our cars looking at the rising sun which was highlighting the snow clad peaks in golden hues. With a heavy heart we bid adieu to the mountains which were our home for the past 5 days. 
For the first time, I had not thought twice before drinking water from a stream on our way, had not worried too much if the utensils were clean, lived in a tent with no security as such. I am thankful to the mountains which helped me discover a “new me”. Will definitely revisit the mountains for more such discoveries.


**Trip duration:**  6 days, 5 nights.

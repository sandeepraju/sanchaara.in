Ah, the Himalayas! A paradise for some and a challenge for others. I’ve always wanted to go to the Himalayas and experience it first hand. I wanted to see what the excitement was all about. Things fell into place during December 2014 and we were off on a trek to Dalhousie. I guess that’s where the mountains cast a spell on me. They say that the mountains pull you back. And in May 2015, they did. This time, the destination was Roopkund, the mystery lake!

I’m a photographer and I get excited about astronomy as well. I’ve been seeing the images of The Milky Way for a long time on television. When a friend of mine, Setu, wrote a <a href="https://secondclassleeper.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/the-night-sky-peacock-story-behind-the-milky-way-image/">blog post</a> about an image of The Milky Way he had captured, I was spellbound! At that moment, I knew what my next destination was; Roopkund! Coincidentally, a bunch of folks at my workplace were planning on a trek to Roopkund as well. We registered for the Roopkund trek via <a href="http://indiahikes.in/">Indiahikes</a>, came up with an itinerary, purchased the supplies and we were off!

Before you read on, do take a look at the trailer that I’ve compiled. The full length is still in work-in-progress status. I'll update the blog once it's complete.

<b>Preparations for the trek:</b>

<b>Itinerary</b>

This was a 11-day trip in total, from Bangalore to Bangalore. We took a flight from Bangalore to Delhi, followed by a train from Delhi to Katgodham the same night. From Katgodham, we went to Nainital by bus and stayed there for a couple of days. From Nainital, we went to Lohajung Base Camp by a rented car. Roopkund trek begins from Lohajung Base Camp. After six days, we returned to Lohajung Base Camp. From Lohajung Base Camp, we went to Katgodham by a rented car. We took a train from Katgodham to Delhi, followed by a flight back to Bangalore. This was a well-planned trip and we didn’t have to make decisions on-the-go. The flight tickets, train tickets, rented car and the trek registration were booked in advance.

<b>Budget</b>

Coming up with an cost-effective itinerary is challenging indeed. The entire trip cost me around ₹30,000. The registration for the trek is around ₹10,500. Make sure you book your flight tickets early. Since we were flying from Bangalore to Delhi, it cost around ₹10,000, inclusive of onward and return journey. The train tickets between Delhi and Katgodham cost around ₹1,500 I think. I had bought most of my trekking equipments from <a href="http://www.decathlon.in">Decathlon</a>, so I’m not including the cost of those equipments over here. I’d say the cost of the equipment would be around ₹16,000 - ₹18,000. Nainital detour, car rental and other miscellaneous costs lead upto around ₹8,500.

<b>Physical Fitness</b>

Roopkund is a high altitude trek with moderate-difficult rating. It is recommended that you keep yourself physically fit. Since I cycle regularly to office, I didn’t exclusively prepare for the trek. The Indiahikes team recommends that you start with slow jogs and increase your pace and distance. By the time your trek starts you need to be able to jog for 4.5 kms under 30 mins.

<b>The Roopkund experience:</b>

<b>Day 1 | 15th May, 2015 | Bangalore - Delhi - Katgodham</b>

We (Navaneeth, Kavya, Shiva, Divya and me) had booked a 5pm flight from Bangalore to Delhi. It was bound to reach Delhi by 7:45pm and it ran a bit late. We had a train to catch from Delhi to Katgodham at 10:45pm, or so we thought. There are a whole bunch of railway stations in Delhi and it’s very confusing if you’re new to the city. We double-checked that it was the Old Delhi Railway station that we’re departing from. Battling the traffic, we somehow made it to the railway station at 10:10pm. Since we had another half an hour to go, we thought of having dinner. We waited at the restaurant till 10:20pm and figured it’d be late. Me, Kavya and Divya started towards the platform, while Navaneeth and Shiva were to join us later with the packed food. Just when we reached the platform and were searching for our compartment, the train started to move! It was 10:30pm. We had split up while searching, and had to get on the train in different compartments. We had no clue if Navaneeth and Shiva had made it. We gave them a call and found out that they had boarded after quite a bit of sprinting. We reached Katgodham the next morning.

A piece of advice, it’s not good enough if you’re on time. Reach early and always keep buffer.

<b>Day 2 | 16th May, 2015 | Katgodham - Nainital</b>

The train station was pretty empty when we reached early morning. After freshening up a bit, we had tea and took a bus to Nainital. Buses are quite frequent along this route. We reached Nainital in about 1.5 hours. We had booked the government rest house and it was pretty good. It turned out to be economical and we had a good view of Nainital lake from the room. After a boat ride in Nainital lake, we roamed around the streets of Nainital. It’s a pretty good place with good food to eat. We went to the market and explored the place a bit. As night fell, the lake lit up with the reflections from the nearby households on the slope. It was a wonderful sight to watch.

![Nainital](https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/18291962785_69ed4845f1_k.jpg)

<b>Day 3 | 17th May, 2015 | Nainital</b>

We hit the Zoo! Yes, there’s a high altitude Zoo in Nainital. The ‘ascent’ up the route from the lake to the zoo itself is tiring. If we’re struggling to climb along this simple route, we’re screwed for the trek, we thought. After a few photo sessions, we left for Naina Devi temple. Next, we visited Eco Cave Gardens. I recorded a few shots from my recently bought GoPro over there. I had never given it a roll before. Little did I know that this would turn out to be a bad decision. And I had no clue how the videos/images were turning out to be. On the way back, we shopped for some souvenirs and returned to the room.

<b>Day 4 | 18th May, 2015 | Nainital - Lohajung</b>

Day 4 was all about hitting the road. We had rented a car and it takes around 6-7 hours to reach Lohajung from Nainital. The route is scenic. You get occasional glimpses of lower Himalayan ranges. It’s like they’re playing hide and seek with you. The needle-like leaves along the route indicated that the area would be covered in snow during winter. It’s amazing how evolution has led life to thrive in harsh conditions. We reached Lohajung Base camp around 3 in the afternoon. Other trekkers hadn’t arrived yet. We were greeted by our trek leader and camp leader. Ours was the second batch in the trekking programme. It’s always better to book an early ticket for treks involving snow. We finished the onsite registration and collected the trekking poles. Trust me, you <b>need</b> a trekking pole! As the evening fell, other trekkers started to pour in, and so did the rain.

![Lohajung - Sunlight piercing through the clouds after a moderate rainfall](https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/17669307454_c125ee7bd9_k.jpg)

We looked towards the direction of Roopkund. Dark gloomy clouds hovering over the trek path was not something we wanted to see. After a while, we were briefed about the trek, it’s difficulty, do’s and dont’s. Quite frankly, I was a bit eery after listening to how things could go wrong. Apparently, AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness) is more serious than I initially thought it was. We were advised to start off on a Diamox dosage, which I didn’t. Just when I was mentally preparing for the trek, bad news struck! The forest department had closed down the trekking path due to unforeseen circumstances. I was heartbroken.

This can’t be happening! The two main reasons I was very excited about the Roopkund trek was The Milky Way and the skeletons. I wanted to make a travelogue. I wanted to trek on the snow. I wanted to experience the trek! But it looked like the mountains had other plans. I went to bed, disappointed.

<b>Day 5 | 19th May, 2015 | Lohajung - Ghairoli Patal</b>

<b>Ghairoli Patal Camp | 10,200ft | <a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/30%C2%B011'59.5%22N+79%C2%B039'09.1%22E/@30.199873,79.652528,766m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0">(30.199873, 79.652528)</a></b>

I woke up with a glimmer of hope that the forest department would allow for the trek. Even if the forest department allowed the trek, what if nature had other plans for us, I thought in a corner of my mind. But it didn’t matter. The trek was still closed. We decided to hike to a nearby hill. Well, something is better than nothing. This was a good opportunity to socialize with the trekkers. We were a pretty diverse group. We had doctors, a captain of a ship, an enthusiastic professor, grad students, photographers, a 13-year old and IT guys (ofcourse). I started shooting the videos for my travelogue on the top of the hill. The trek leader briskly gathered us around for an announcement; We have to rush back for an important announcement. The trek was on!

We were behind schedule though. By the time we got back to the base camp, it was already 10:30 and we had to leave by 11:45. The actual trek starts from Wan village. It’s an hour’s drive from Lohajung to Wan. We started the actual trek at 1 in the afternoon. If things went according to schedule, we would’ve covered 3/4th the distance to Ghairoli Patal. The reason that people prefer to start early is the rapidly changing and unpredictable Himalayan weather.

Indiahikes follow a very good practice of supplying eco bags for the “Green Trails” campaign. The ideology behind this is campaign is to leave behind a cleaner the trekking path than the one you tread on. A guide from the surrounding area accompanies the trekkers for every trek. At the start of the trek, there is a small Nanda Devi mandir. We prayed and flagged off the trek. “Roopkund, here we come!”, I thought. This portion involves a small ascent, followed by a descent to the Neel Ganga river, and an ascent to the Ghairoli Patal. The initial ascent is a stony laid-out path. The descent to Neel Ganga is like any other hillside trek. We relaxed a bit at Neel Ganga and started the ascent. Boy, what an ascent that was! A few got breathless and most of us were tired. No wonder people hire mules to carry their luggage. But I was determined <i>not</i> to hire one, although my bag was extra heavy (why? read on!).

As the evening set, the bright blue sky turned gloomy grey. It was about to rain and we took our ponchos out. They’re not as light as you’d expect them to be. Luckily, the rain stopped after a drizzle. We finally reached Ghairoli Patal at 6. There is no electrical connectivity from this point onwards. Mobile signals were performing a balancing act. I could see people roaming around the camp hooked on to the little bars on their mobile screens. And as usual, I started shooting for my travelogue. The night set in and we were tired from the journey. We had dinner and crept into our sleeping bags for a good night’s sleep. I knew that the next day was gonna exciting, but I had largely underestimated it!

<b>Day 6 | 20th May, 2015 | Ghairoli Patal - Bedni Bugyal</b>

<b>Bedni Bugyal Camp | 11,700ft | <a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/30%C2%B012'19.6%22N+79%C2%B039'44.2%22E/@30.205447,79.662283,766m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0">(30.205447, 79.662283)</a></b>

I open my eyes all of a sudden and my watch reads 3:30. I’m not a morning person. In fact, I often sleep at 3:30 and this felt strange. Very strange. I don’t know how I woke up, but I realized why I did. All I had to was step out of my tent into the cold and look up at the Himalayan night sky. Gazillions of stars staring at you! The light from their cores must’ve traveled for millions of years, only to hit you in the eye all at once. I was ecstatic. Instantly, I knew what I had to do. I pulled out my camera, setup my tripod and pointed it to the South sky. This was the moment that I had been waiting for.. The Milky Way!

![Gharoli Patal - The Milky Way!](https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/18288020972_bc85ebb7c5_k.jpg)

![The *excited* writeup!](https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_7850.jpg)

I didn’t know I was gonna fulfil one of dreams this early in the trek. The average human tendency to share the excitement drove me to wake Navaneeth up and show the images. I wanted to shoot more and it was already 4. By the time I followed the Milky Way’s tail, I started to see a blue tinge of sunlight in my photos. Obviously, I had woken up too late. Needless to say, I wanted to try again. Opportunities like these are very rare indeed. Here’s an excerpt from the night’s script:

With a glimmer of satisfaction in my eyes, I crawled back into my sleeping bag again. After a couple of hours of sleep, it was time to prepare for the next higher camp. The trek leaders had an oxymeter. They checked the oxygen levels in the blood twice a day for every trekker. We left for the next camp, Bedni Bugyal.

This path starts with an ascent in the dense forests till Ali Bugyal, with occasional descents. From Ali bugyal, it’s a gradual ascent followed by a slight descent to Bedni Bugyal. The trek through the dense forest was not as tiring as the previous day’s ascent. The Himalayan terrain changes every 1,000 ft. It’s not a gradual change at all. You can notice the change unfolding right before your eyes. It was bright and sunny on this path. It’s advised that you keep yourself hydrated at all times. Have small pints of water frequently.

I wasn’t particularly keeping a tab on my camera batteries. After all, I was carrying a DSLR, and DSLR batteries are supposed to last for days. Well, they do, under normal conditions. But Himalayas is <i>not</i> normal. I had carried one extra battery thinking that it would be sufficient. By the middle of the day, I had exhausted one battery pack. But that’s ok. I had another whole battery left, right? Wrong! I hadn’t kept the battery warm and the charge had reduced to 1/3rd overnight. Well, there goes my dream to capture The Milky Way again. I still had my GoPro, but that’s not gonna help me in capturing the stars, does it?  Besides, the GoPro batteries ran into the same problem and I didn’t have any spares. I had taken my portable charger as well. I occasionally charged my GoPro with little, but sufficient, success.

Remember folks, always keep your batteries warm and carry spare ones.

Ali bugyal is a beautiful meadow, covered with a blanket of grass and flowers. The forest ends abruptly, opening up a meadow. It’s a beautiful sight to watch. We saw our patch of snow here. We rested here for a while. No one really wanted to get up and leave for Bedni. But you know how the Himalayan weather changes. We reluctantly got up and were on our way. The gradual ascent is more of a hilly path, occasionally getting rocky. As we treaded along for a couple of hours or so, the snow covered mountains began showing up at a distance. We could see a trail of snow being blown off the summit. The winds must’ve been strong. “What would it be like if one was stranded in such an environment?”, I thought to myself. As we traced the path downhill, we could see a couple of blue dots. Finally, Bedni Bugyal was in sight!

Some of the trekkers spent the afternoon playing cricket at the camp, and some spent watching it. Me? Shooting, ofcourse. Although I was constraining myself from shooting, I was running really low on batteries. The first thing that I did after reaching Bedni was to find out which direction is South. There was a small hill towards South. I wanted to have another go at shooting the Milky Way that night and this was a better composition. Considering the position of the Milky Way the previous night, it was quite simple to deduce that the galaxy would rise behind the hill around 1 AM.

Around 4 in the evening, winds picked up and it started raining heavily. Talk about Himalayan weather, eh? I thought my plans for the night will go for a toss. Luckily, the skies cleared up in a couple of hours and all was well. We had dinner (one of the best, I must say!) and some of the trekkers were curious to know more about how to tune the camera to shoot the stars. Well, I can’t say no to a photography gyaan. I spent the next hour explaining how a camera works in simple terms. To put it in practice, they wanted to join me for the night’s shoot. We slept at 9 and woke up at 12, shot till 2 and crawled back into the cozy sleeping bags again. Here’s what we could shoot:

![The Milky Way!](https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_4532.jpg)

At this point in time, my camera battery had completely died out!

<b>Day 7 | 21st May, 2015 | Bedni Bugyal - Pathar Nachauni</b>

<b>Pathar Nachauni Camp | 13,000ft | <a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/30%C2%B014'00.7%22N+79%C2%B041'40.3%22E/@30.2335136,79.6945158,766m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0">(30.2335136,79.6945158)</a></b>

From Bedni Bugyal, we had to ascend back to the trail. This was a relatively steep ascent compared to the gradual one the previous day. The steep ascent was followed by a gradual one till Pathar Nachauni. To reach the Pathar Nachauni camp, we had to go off track and descend a bit.

As we started ascending from Bedni Bugyal, we got to see Bedni kund. This is a small lake with a mandir. I wanted to get a shot of the lake, but my batteries were down. I had put my GoPro to charge overnight. A quick tip, don’t! I ended up losing half the charge on my portable charger, with the GoPro retaining none.

![Bedni Kund, on the way to Pathar Nachauni](https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/17669196684_c46b5736ed_k.jpg)

The terrain changes so quickly as we gain altitude in the Himalayas. Into an hour of trekking, the meadows opened up to a rocky terrain. Apparently, it had snowed at higher altitudes the previous night. Luckily, the weather was stable now. As we gained altitude, we could see snow deposited on either side of the path. This was our first encounter with the snow-ridden path and we all were pretty excited. There were some men clearing the trekking path for us ahead.

![The path to Pathar Nacahauni](https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/17671317713_933fa28c87_k.jpg)

Trekking on the snow was harder than I had anticipated. It would’ve probably been easier if it weren’t for my swaying camera bag and a heavy backpack. I moved to the front of the group to shoot the video. I found out the hard way that shooting, balancing and climbing is a tough task. I slipped and fell a couple of times. Mules do not carry the luggage up till Pathar Nachauni. There is a place called Ghora Lautani, which literally translates to “place where horses turn back”. Pathar Nachauni literally translates to ”dancers made of rock”. There is a local legend behind this place which explains the name.

As we reached Pathar Nachauni around 1 in the afternoon, the winds picked up. During the course of the stay, we realized that this was the windiest camp of them all. But it was a beautiful sight nevertheless, with the tents facing the Kaali Daak mountain. I was feeling more tired than usual, probably because of the rugged sleep the previous two nights. I took a dose of some pain killers, and a diamox as a precaution.

After dinner, I casually washed the utensils in the cold water with my bare hands. It felt normal initially, but within a minute, I felt like there were microscopic needles embedded in my palm and they growing in size. I shouted in pain! Trying to warm my hands up quickly was a worse decision. The agitation increased by folds. Gradually allowing the palm to reach room temperature was the best remedy. Excited about the next day’s trek, I had a good night’s sleep.

A piece of advice, never rinse your bare hands with cold water at 9 in the himalayan night.

![Nothing beats hot tea in during the cold, windy evenings.](https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/18291908975_34999c0c3e_k.jpg)

<b>Day 8 | 22nd May, 2015 | Pathar Nachauni - Bhagwabasa</b>

<b>Bhagwabasa Camp | 15,000 ft | <a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/30%C2%B015'06.6%22N+79%C2%B042'45.0%22E/@30.251835,79.712492,766m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0">(30.251835, 79.712492)</a></b>

That was a much needed refreshing sleep! The trek would get much more interesting from this point onwards. We had heard that the Bhagwabasa camp was completely on snow! Layers and layers of snow. It was going to be a relatively harder trek for the next couple of days. The trekking path was an ascent till Kalu Vinayak temple and a gradual descent to Bhagwabasa camp.

We were given a facility to deposit a few of the luggage at Pathar Nachauni. Since my camera bag was giving me troubles, I deposited it over there. We were also given snow grippers. Its an elastic addon with metallic spikes at the bottom. It helps in providing grip while trekking on snow. The trek leaders showed us how to use them and would instruct us to put it on when required.

The trek up to Kalu Vinayak temple was a hard one. The path was primarily rocky and there was occasional snow along the trekking path. While we were struggling to walk on the snow, I could see some locals running down the slopes of the snow-ridden mountains. “Given enough time, anyone can do anything.”, I thought. By the time we reached Kalu Vinayak temple, I was very disappointed. You’re on a peak. You look around and you see the mighty Himalayan peaks all around you. Wow, what a sight! You look down at your feet, and you’re standing on garbage! Wow (sarcasm), what a sight! Remember the eco bags that we had? I picked up most of the throwaways and deposited them into the eco bag. I highly encourage you to pick up the plastics along your trek path, wherever that is.

After Kalu Vinayak temple, the path was completely covered in snow. The trek leaders instructed us to put on the grippers, and we did. Trust me, it makes a lot of difference! If it weren’t for the grippers, I’m pretty we would’ve skid and fallen off at many points in the trek. After a couple of hours of trekking on the snow, we finally reached Bhagwabasa. And boy, what a beautiful campsite it was!

All the fatigue had magically vanished and we were full of enthusiasm. The camp was completely covered in snow. They had laid out tents on top of the snow. The camp was very hygienic. There was absolutely no vegetation. The trees had vanished long back along the trek path. The grass had vanished somewhere along the way to Kalu Vinayak temple. There was no flowing water at all. The organizers literally dug deep into the old snow, heated it up and provided water for us to drink. We were asked to compulsorily get sunglasses, but I hadn’t realized why. The reflection off the snow has a very profound effect on the eye. I couldn’t stay without my sunglasses even for a minute. The higher Himalayas is such a hostile environment. I never thought I’d be burning under sun when there’s snow all around me. There was a special team at the campsite to take us to Roopkund and back the following morning.

A place right next to the camp was slightly elevated. We used this a slide. People went crazy over it and we started taking turns sliding. Although I wanted to save the charge on my GoPro, I couldn’t resist taking it out again. My DSLR battery was all out! We had some fun shoots with the GoPro and used it for what it’s meant to be used for.. sports. Then came the snow ball fights, followed by hot tea. Ah, good times! Sipping hot tea on a snow covered Himalayan was a different experience altogether. I struck an item off my wishlist.

As the evening fell, people began clicking pictures. I felt handicapped without a DSLR. A quarter capacity of the portable charger was all that I had left. And I had to save the last for the best. The sunset on this fine evening is something that I can never forget! High altitude Himalayan sunsets are so serene. Now I understand why people get lost in philosophical thoughts. It cannot be explained, it can only be experienced.

![Himalayan Sunset at Bhagwabasa. Photo Credits: Subramanian M](https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/roopkund_bhagwabasa.jpg)

The first thing that I did while I was entering the campsite was to checkout out the composition towards South. Kaali Daak, a snow covered peak, was standing in all it’s might. I could imagine how The Milky Way would be positioned against the mountain. I could imagine how I would compose the image. I knew the exact camera settings that I had to make to get that perfect shot. I knew the exact time that I had to get up to get that shot. The weather was clear and the stage was set!

Except that I had no charge on my DSLR left.

<b>Day 9 | 23rd May, 2015 | Bhagwabasa - Roopkund - Pathar Nachauni</b>

<b>Roopkund | 15,750 ft | <a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/30%C2%B015'44.5%22N+79%C2%B043'53.4%22E/@30.262358,79.731487,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0">(30.262358, 79.731487)</a></b>

Luckily, our extremely energetic professor and photographer, Subramanian sir, came to my rescue. He had a few spare batteries and lent one to me. I had requested him to join me in the photoshoot that I was planning for the night, and he obliged. We were supposed to start the trek to Roopkund at 4am the next morning. We knew it was going to be hard to shoot and we wouldn’t be getting enough sleep for the next day’s trek. But this is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Carrying a tripod, DSLR and lenses all the way to the top along with other necessities was damn hard. Moreover, getting up and stepping out of the tent at 1 in the bone chilling night at higher altitudes wasn't as easy as I had thought. I took off my gloves to setup the tripod and camera. By the time I was done, I couldn't feel my fingers due to the cold. All this, after a tiring trek the previous day and more tiring and a sleepless trek up ahead. I set the focus on my lens and pointed my camera towards the Kaali Daak peak. I made some settings and clicked the shutter release. And voilà, this is the image:

![The Grand Galaxy: Milky May, as seen from Bhagwabasa at 12:59 AM on 23rd May, 2015.](https://sancharaa.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/18288008532_0de7b4c5a8_k.jpg)

The key to capturing the grand galaxy is to know when and where to shoot. From my previous attempt at Khajjiar lake during December, I figured that the moonless, cloudless nights at a place without light pollution during the peak of the summer is the best time to shoot the Milky Way in the Northern Hemisphere. A lot of stuff just fell in place. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been possible for me to capture this beauty. Coincidentally, this trek was a perfect match for the requirement. The trek was almost cancelled before it even started. Although I had run out of batteries, Subramanian sir was kind enough to share his spare battery pack. The weather was clear. I must say, I’m very lucky to have captured this image.

I went back to the tent at 2:00 in the night. We were supposed to get up at 3:00 and start for Roopkund at 4:00. I was too excited to sleep. I mean, how could one sleep when one of their dreams had just come true? The organizers started waking everyone up at 3:00, and the preparations began. Why were we leaving so early? Snow, ofcourse. It’s easier to trek on hard snow, compared to soft, melting snow. The special team gathered us up and started giving instructions. We were asked to carry flash lights and goggles compulsorily. They insisted a lot on discipline. It plays a very important role in the mountains. We were given some dry fruits to carry along with us. We had formed a line and were waiting for others to join in. The clock was ticking, but there were delays. When it struck 4:00, the special team started leading us forward, leaving others behind. That’s how serious they were about discipline. In about 5 minutes, others caught up. Another 5 minutes down the trek, the organizers realized that some of the trekkers hadn’t got their goggles. Once the sun is up, it’s virtually impossible to trek back to the camp without goggles. They were sent back. Yes, the organizers are very serious about this. Those trekkers went back to the camp and managed to find a pair of goggles and caught up to us.

For me, trekking on the hard snow at 4 AM with a flashlight and trekking pole was a thrilling experience! One slip, and you would roll over down the mountain. I was scared to look down at first, but eventually, I got used to it. Trekking pole serves as a third leg while ascending and descending. Without it, it’s virtually impossible to trek, unless you’re exposed to this environment. I wasn’t feeling all that well and energetic. For some reason, I couldn’t even talk clearly. Probably, the lack of sleep the previous night had something to do with it. There was even a point in time during the ascent when I just wanted it to be finished. I was carrying my DSLR and a couple of lenses in my bag as well. This added a lot of extra difficulty. The brain said “Give up!”, heart said “No!”. (and the mouth couldn’t say anything. I couldn’t speak properly, remember?). The path twists and turns, with some crazy ascents. You keep toggling between hill side and valley side trekking. As a typical trekking group, the individual speeds of the trekkers vary a lot. This makes the group spread wide along the trail. The trek leaders did a wonderful job of keeping the team together. However, the downside of this was the long waiting time everytime we regrouped and reorganized. After a long 3 hour trek, we were finally able to see the Roopkund valley at a distance, and there were cheers. After one final push up the steep slope, we had finally made it!

We congratulated one another and spent time clicking pictures and shooting videos. It was a moment of rejoice. This is what we had trekked so long and hard for. We didn’t climb down till the frozen lake as it was risky. On the top, I noticed that I hadn’t tied my shoe lace properly. This made the ascent much more tougher. Sadly, we couldn’t see any of the skeletal remains either. That disappointed me a bit, but that’s alright. You can’t have the cake and eat it too. There’s always next time. No one went up to Junargali either, as we were running out of time. I still remember the taste of hot parathas on the top. Yes, one of the guides had actually carried hot parathas till the peak, just for us.

Finally, it was time to bid goodbye to Roopkund. I was the last person to leave the valley, which is pretty obvious because I’m a photographer. The team had moved forward. One of the guides was with me. In other of the steep descents, we had to take a curvy path to descend. The guide just held my hand starting running down the descent in a straight line. I was scared to death! Only then, did I realize the power of the grippers. Had I realized it before, the ascent would’ve been much easier. I was pretty confident from that point onwards and even started running down the mountain further along the trek. The guides informed that it’s all about balance. All we had to do was keep our body vertical, and the rest followed.

As we were nearing Bhagwabasa, there was a point where we could slide down the mountain. The guides did it first and some trekkers followed. Usually, I’m not the sort who tries these kinda stuff out, but I thought I would give it a try since the guides were around. You’d start sliding down the mountain when one guide pushes you. You should control the speed and direction with your legs. The guides at the bottom will stop you once you reach there. I switched on my GoPro and started sliding. Mid-way, I totally lost control, rotated and started sliding down the mountain head-first with no control over speed! If a couple of guides hadn’t stopped me (one of whom I hurt with the momentum), that video would’ve probably been my last!

After a while, we reached Bhagwabasa camp. We rested there for a while, had lunch and left for Pathar Nachauni. Nothing much interesting (compared to the onward trek atleast) happened over the next trek routes. We reached Pathar Nachauni around 3 in the afternoon. We had tea and spent some time chit chatting over the Roopkund experience. As night fell, we had dinner and curled up in our sleeping bags, with a sense of achievement.

<b>Day 10 | 24th May, 2015 | Pathar Nachauni - Bedni Bugyal - Ghairoli Patal - Wan village - Lohajung</b>

“Pathar Nachauni to Wan in a day? They must be crazy!”, I thought. We took 3 days to trek from Wan to Pathar Nachauni. How in the world are we gonna trek from Pathar Nachauni to Wan in a day? I know that it’s a descent, but they’re difficult as well. We left a bit early and went from Pathar Nachauni to Bedni Bugyal. We didn’t stop at Bedni. Apparently, there was a shortcut from Bedni to Ghairoli, which doesn’t pass through Ali Bugyal. We made it to Ghairoli Patal around lunch time. And guess what we had for lunch.. Maggi! Post-lunch, we left for Wan. We spent some time near the Neel Ganga river and I gave a waterproof GoPro a wade inside the water. The water was damn clear! Finally, we reached Wan around 4 in the afternoon, with a great sense of satisfaction and achievement. Some vehicles were waiting for us to take us back to Lohajung Base camp. In the night, the certificates were distributed and a couple of awards were announced; the most eco-friendly trekker and the best trekker, both of which were received by our beloved professor and photographer, Subbu sir. Well deserved indeed!

<b>Day 11 | 25th May, 2015 | Lohajung - Katgodham</b>

Nothing much to say here. It was a good scenic ride. All along the way, I kept re-living those amazing moments in the trek. We had a train to Delhi in the night.

<b>Day 12 | 26th May, 2015 | Katgodham - Delhi - Bangalore</b>

We reached Delhi in the morning. We took a flight from Delhi to Bangalore at 8:15 AM.

Home, Sweet Home!

<b>In a nutshell:
</b>

This was my hardest and highest trek till date. This 6-day trek in the high altitudes offered a lot of terrains. First, there were dense forests, followed by plain grasslands, rocky terrains, hard snow, soft melting snow and even cement tracks. There were a lot of sleepless nights, slips, falls, fatigue and a good amount of tan. Thanks <a href="http://indiahikes.in/">indiahikes.in</a>, for organizing such an amazing trek. The food was amazing, especially the hot gulab jamun at the highest camp and maggi during the descent. Its virtually impossible to reach roopkund without the help of the local guides. They taught us the tips and tricks of trekking across different terrains and narrated the stories behind the places that we were crossing. The technical team for the last ascent was equally amazing! I managed to get a few snaps that I had been craving since years. Carrying most of my photography equipment to the top was totally worth it! This was also the first time I was shooting with my new GoPro Hero. I managed to capture some amazing videos and I plan to make a travelogue out of it soon.
